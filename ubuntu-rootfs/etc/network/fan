# FAN overlay network map.

# The FAN is a very fast overlay network system for docker in cloud
# environments with limited IP addresses. The FAN multiplies host
# addresses by mapping them to a larger overlay network. It eliminates
# the need for a central database and myriad tunnels by mapping
# addresses mathematically.

# This map file specifies the list of maps which can be enabled in
# /etc/network/interfaces or using the "fanctl config" command. See also
# fanatic(1) for a tool that will configure docker to use your fans.
# The only absolute rule is that all your participating machines use
# the same mapping for active fans.

# The map translates a local address range to an overlay range.

# RFC1918 - we recommend you use these for easy interop with other
# FAN users on small private networks. They provide around 250 IP's
# per 192.168.0.0/16 address, or 16 per 172.16.0.0/12 address.

# local          overlay       options
192.168.0.0/16   250.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12    251.0.0.0/8

# RFC1918 VPC - we recommend you use the higher ranges of 10.0.0.0/8
# for your docker-centric VPC. This example provides 1,000 IP's per
# base IP in 10.254.0.0/16.

10.254.0.0/16    252.0.0.0/8
10.254.0.0/16    253.0.0.0/8
10.254.0.0/16    254.0.0.0/8

# CUSTOM
#
# You can map large ranges onto your own, smaller, ranges for address
# space expansion purposes. We recommend you adopt a common mapping for
# your entire institution.
