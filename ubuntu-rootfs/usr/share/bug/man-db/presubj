Reporting man-db bugs
---------------------

If you are reporting a bug in the operation of the programs themselves
rather than the packaging, please include the output of the program in
question when run with the --debug flag. For instance, if 'man bash'
fails to display the bash(1) manual page correctly, I will usually want
to see the output of 'man --debug bash'.
