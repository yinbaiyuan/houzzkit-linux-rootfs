# libmbim-glib uses the mbim-proxy binary internally which was split out into
# a separate package when converting to multi-arch. As we don't want to
# create a circular dependency by making libmbim-glib depend on libmbim-proxy,
# we instead make every package linking against libmbim-glib have an explicit
# dependency on libmbim-proxy.
