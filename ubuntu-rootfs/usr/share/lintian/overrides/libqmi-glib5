# libqmi-glib uses the qmi-proxy binary internally which was split out into
# a separate package when converting to multi-arch. As we don't want to
# create a circular dependency by making libqmi-glib depend on libqmi-proxy,
# we instead make every package linking against libqmi-glib have an explicit
# dependency on libqmi-proxy.
