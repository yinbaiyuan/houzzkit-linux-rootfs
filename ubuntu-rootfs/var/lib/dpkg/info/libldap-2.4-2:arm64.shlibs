# While only libldap_r is packaged, the client programs are linked 
# against libldap during build. This is here just to satisfy 
# dpkg-shlibdeps for ldap-utils: libldap is not around when 
# dpkg-gensymbols runs, so it's not listed in the symbols file. A better 
# long-term workaround will be to patch the upstream build system so the 
# client programs are linked against libldap_r.
